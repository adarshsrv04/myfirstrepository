//Okay???
//Thanks, I understand some parts but I think I have to //take some more time to grab all the code
//umm okay so shall we submit?
//Will it be available after submission?
//even idk iam new to interviewbit
//Okay Can I copy this to another window?
//ofc yes
//BTW your name?
//Thanku
//Adarsh and urs?
//Abhigna
//Thanks for helping me
//Can u please teach me some tips and trick of CP?
//iam still learning 
//Okay Is there any way to contact u for further help if //needed;)
//social media?
//because i don't think interview bit has an option to contact if yes lemme know
//Okay Instagram?
//Okay!
//Abhigna.25
//Btw how u learn coding:)
//iam still learning, part of it in college and online course
//I requested u on insta..please check
//oh yeah i did
//Ok i've to go can we end this?
//Btw ur coding skill is awesome 
// Okay please suggest me some sources which could help me to improve my coding skills
//which college are you from?
//Actually I am a bca student..final year
//where are you from?
//India and u?
//udemy is good for cp courses 
//Okay I will check that out
// Can we take the test on interviewbit again?
//i dont know how interview bit matches its peers i think it's quiet random i don't think we can take the test again
//Oh ok any other coding platform?
//okay what is ur user id on interviewbit.? 
//abhigna-amarraju 
//okay i will try to reach u here if any way is available
//okay fine
//okay thanku for ur time
://)click swap roles
//
//i've to go now we'll submit this okay?
